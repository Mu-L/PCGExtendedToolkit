# v0.65 - Cooking

{% hint style="danger" %}
This release is being worked on and reflect the state of github main branch; it is not available on FAB yet.
{% endhint %}

## New Nodes

No new nodes.

Hoping for:

* Path : Manhattan
* Path : Stitch (to stitch disconnected paths together)
* Path : Insert on Segments (to insert points into an existing path)
* Relax : Gravity

## Filters

No new filters.

## Tweaks

### Flood Fill Path Output Optimization

There are some new optimization for the [Cluster' Flood Fill](../../node-library/clusters/flood-fill/) node relative to paths!\
You can now output an "optimized" version of the path to ensure an output that has no overlaps; and either pick to preserve longer paths first, or shorter paths first.

### Offset Path

Back in the days, [Offset](../../node-library/paths/offset.md) had a not-so-good "cleanup" option â€” it's back, and it's better and more reliable! It has a few edge-cases that are hard to cover, and few things to iron out still, but it proudly handles most common cases.

### WaitForPCGData

The [WaitForPCGData](../../node-library/misc/wait-for-pcg-data.md) node now supports per-data (@Data domain) instance.&#x20;

This comes with two new subgraphs as part of the plugin content to spawn & execute PCG graphs easily (_not sure my approach is super efficient, but heh!_)

> Note that these subgraph each **instantiate a new actor** to execute the graph, which by default is destroyed after the generation is complete.

## Bugfixes

* Sneaky bufix on [Attribute Remap](../../node-library/metadata/attribute-remap.md) that was crashing the editor if you wanted to output the value to a new attribute.
