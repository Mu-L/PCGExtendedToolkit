{% endhint %}

## New Nodes

No new filters.

## Tweaks

### Flood Fill Path Output Optimization

There are some new optimization for the floodfill node relative to paths!\
You can now output an "optimized" version of the path to ensure an output that has no overlaps; and either pick to preserve longer paths first, or shorter paths first.
