# 5.x → 5.6 Upcoming Changes

## Updated default values

A handful of nodes have had their default value changed. **If you were using these nodes without having ever changed the factory settings**, behavior will change in existing graphs.

### Find Clusters

Find Cluster default mode has been changed from `Find from Edges` to `All.`

> This will likely affect any loop subgraph that was looping over clusters.

### Sample : Nearest Points, Bounds, and others

Samplers default blending interface has been changed from Monolithic to Individual.

> This will make it look like all graphs that rely on samplers are now broken and don't sample attributes properly — worry not! **You just need to change the "blending interface" to `Monolithic` , previous setting still exist there.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Unless you are effectively interested in blending everything, it is now recommended to cherry pick individual attributes you want to sample using external blend ops subnodes.&#x20;

_This makes it easier to tweak blending and remap sampled attributes to a different name._
{% endhint %}

Note that the above is also true of **Cluster : Edge Properties** !

### Bevel "Is Endpoint" is now "Is Pole"

In order to reduce confusion between a bevel _End_ point and bevel _Endpoints_ points, they've been renamed. The default value of the attribute has changed from `IsBevelEndpoint` to `IsBevelPole`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This will likely throw errors that an attribute named "IsBevelEndpoint" doesn't exist if you did not rename it.
{% endhint %}

### Shapes

Resolution mode is now Fixed (Count) by default, instead of Distance.

Bounds are now 100x100x100 on shape points, instead of 1x1x1

## Fixes that will look like bugs

Previously, Path & Spline inclusion filters would require one to use "Inside" to test if points were outside, and "Outside" to test if points were inside. This is not true anymore, and will work according to the CCW winding of the input

> This means you likely need to update your inside to outside (including the variants "or on" & "and on")

## Deprecations

The Neighbor Sampler used to have two separate sampler subnodes, [Sampler : Vtx Attributes](../../node-library/sampling/sample-neighbors/sampler-vtx-attributes.md) & [Sampler : Vtx Properties](../../node-library/sampling/sample-neighbors/sampler-vtx-properties-1.md). These two are now deprecated and should be replaced by the new, unified [Sampler : Vtx Blend](../../node-library/sampling/sample-neighbors/sampler-vtx-properties.md);&#x20;

> it leverages the all-in-one blend operations that enable easy tweak of blendmode and remapping to different outputs.

## PCGEx Blueprints

There was serious issues with some updates that don't make it easy to pass context to blueprint while multithreading, so custom PCGEx blueprints for the [Actor Data Packer](../../node-library/quality-of-life/pack-actor-data/) & [Custom Graph Builder](../../node-library/clusters/build-custom-graph/custom-graph-builder.md) have their `InitializeWithContext` function renamed to a context-less `Initialize` , and the CustomGraphBuilder methods that were taking Context as a param don't have it anymore.&#x20;

\
&#xNAN;_&#x49;t's not ideal, but it shouldn't be an issue either because it was very useless._
